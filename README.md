# Satellite Orbit Simulation and Analysis Tool

This MATLAB-based project processes TLE data to analyze and visualize satellite orbits. Key features include:
- **3D Orbit Visualization:** Realistic simulation of satellite trajectories.
- **Perturbation Analysis:** Effects of J2 perturbation, atmospheric drag, and solar radiation pressure.
- **Collision Risk Prediction:** Calculates proximity between satellites and issues warnings for potential collisions.
- **Multi-Satellite Simulations:** Visualize and analyze constellations like Starlink.

## Features
1. TLE Data Integration
2. Real-time Orbit Visualization
3. Long-term Perturbation Modeling
4. Collision Risk Analysis

## Getting Started
